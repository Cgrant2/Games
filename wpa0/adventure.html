<font size="6">Hello new recruit, and welcome to your first day in marching band</font>
<p>
<font size="5">Unfortunately, you seem to have forgotten to set your alarm for your first day in band camp, and you have arrived an hour late</font>
<p>
<font size="5">Luckily for you, you're friend has been keeping you up to date on whats going on, and right now every instrument has broken out into sectionals, so you just need to find your fellow flute players</font>
<p>
<font size="5">Good Luck =)</font>
